### Purpose of the Program

The purpose of the program is to track the public transport journeys for a single day. The program accomplishes this by requesting details about each journey, including the starting zone, destination zone, time band (peak or off-peak), and passenger type. The program must store all the journeys with their details in memory to facilitate reviewing, filtering, or removing them as needed later.

The program needs to have a simple menu that contains options through which the user can add journeys by entering the date, the starting zone, end zone, passenger type, whether the journey was peak or off-peak, as the program is calculating the average cost per journey which is the base fair per journey to know the most expensive journey, and all of these depend on the type of journey if it is peak or off-peak.

Additionally, the system also determines this base fare depending on the passenger type, whether they are an adult, student, child, or senior citizen. It might also apply passenger discounts to the base fare according to the dataset, from which we will take the base fare, which is considered the average cost per journey. For example, the Adult will not take a discount, the student will get 25 % discount, the child will get 50 % discount, and the senior citizen will get 30 % discount.

Moreover, each journey should be assigned a unique ID. Therefore, the program should prevent the removal of a journey with an invalid ID. Therefore, the program should show a clear error message and re-prompt the user on invalid input without terminating the program. In addition, the system should apply a daily cap with a specific price to all passenger types’ running total, like the adult, student, child, and senior citizen. At the end, it should display a daily summary including the total number of journeys, total cost charged (sum of all types), average cost per journey based on charged fares, the most expensive journey by charge fare by its ID, count of peak vs off-peak journeys, and count per zone pair or per zone involved.

Validate the Menu_Choice by checking if it equals a number from 0 to 7 by making a Loop that takes the value of the Menu_Choice from the user, and if menuChoice becomes equal to 0, the program exits. The system also handles exceptions/errors if the user inputted an invalid choice for the Menu_Choice by making the user re-prompt if that happened.                                                                                                                                                                           | The outputs are the Menu_Choice options which are like adding a journey, by entering the date, starting zone, destination zone, passenger type, and whether the trip was peak or off-peak, filtering a journey, by passenger type, time band, zone, or date, and viewing summaries such as total costs, averages, and category counts. |

| **Daily summary.**                | Daily_Summary list that contains the total number of journeys (all types), total cost charged (sum across types), average cost per journey. | The program displays this list by taking all the values of the total number of journeys (all types) from the program by making a variable called count that we increment by 1 when any journey is added, using a while loop in the main loop that has the menu options that include adding a journey. Additionally, the program takes the cost charged from taking the to_Zone, from_Zone variables from the user to know the starting zone, destination zone, and then calculates the cost or base fare of each journey by the formula of the zones crossed which is abs(to_Zone – from_Zone) + 1. At the end, it calculates the sum of the cost across all journeys regardless of their types and the average cost per journey. | The output is printing the daily summary of the total number of journeys (all types), total cost charged (sum across types), and average cost per journey.                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Diary Entries

25/01/2026 -Diary Entry 1 – Understanding the Problem & Planning the Gantt Chart:

Firstly, I concentrated on what is required for the program to be done and what a perfect Gantt chart has to include. I started by reading the whole program carefully and decomposing what needs to be done in this milestone into smaller steps, like identifying the purpose of the program, core program functionality, system constraints, and analyzing the input, processes, and outputs of this program by generating an IPO table, which contains all the inputs and outputs of the program.

Additionally, I did all of that to understand the issue very well and know what the program needs to do which is that the program wants to design and build a system that will help a user keep track of their public transport journeys for a single day.

25/01/2026 -Diary Entry 2 – The problems I encountered while solving this milestone:

Honestly, I have not faced many problems while solving this milestone. I just faced few problems in knowing the inputs of the program that are needed to add a journey, filter a journey, or list a journey.

I tried in many ways to solve these problems by reading the brief of the program again or doing research on the parts I do not understand. In the end, hopefully, I could solve all of my problems.
